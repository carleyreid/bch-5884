		<h2>Surface Water Injection into the Floridan Aquifer: Biogeochemical Transformations and Ramifications</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph1">

		<img src="asr.jpg"/>
		<p>My undergraduate research focused on the waters of the <b>Floridan Aquifer System</b>. The Floridan Aquifer System (FAS) occupies an area of approximately 100,000 square miles and underlies portions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and the entirety of Florida. This system is one of the most productive groundwater sources in the world and supplies drinking water to over ten million people. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is a process by which treated surface water is injected into the sub-surface aquifer, stored, and later extracted. ASR is a primary component of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/cerp.htm">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a>, which aims to maintain hydrologic flow between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades. This involves the extraction of surface water from Lake Okeechobee at the confluence of the Kissimmee River and injection into the Upper Floridan Aquifer (UFA), a region of the FAS. Injection of surface water into the FAS, an anoxic water body, and the reintroduction of the mixed water mass into surface waters had not been evaluated prior to my research.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph2">
		<h3 style="color:#8B5FA1;">Methods</h3>
		<p>Samples were collected from the Kissimmee River ASR facility which is located approximately 8,000 feet upstream of the confluence of the Kissimmee River and Lake Okeechobee. Treated recharge water from the facilty was also sampled directly.</p>	
		<p>A time series was constructed to study the potential biogeochemical changes associated with ASR injection of Kissimmee River recharge waters into the FAS. The bacterially mediated transformations within the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool of the FAS were analyzed using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS) to characterize DOM at the elemental level. The impact of nutrient injection into the suspended microbial communities of the FAS was evaluated by contructing a parallel set of microcosms and monitoring the nutrient concentrations using absorbance based colorimetric techniques.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph3">
		<h3 style="color:#4D3459;">Conclusions</h3>
		<p>H/C ratios over time indicate recalcitrance in the DOM pool, but the relative abundance of oxygen-containing compounds did decrease over time. The rate of denitrification was shown to be greater in the biofilm community than the suspended microbial community. Ammonium concentrations were approximately 30 micromolar and stable over time.</p>
